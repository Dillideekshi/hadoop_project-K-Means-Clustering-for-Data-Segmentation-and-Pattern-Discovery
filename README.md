This project explores the use of the k-means algorithm for clustering analysis and pattern discovery in datasets. By applying k-means to a dataset with points centered around the origin and near (9.0, 9.0, 9.0), the algorithm efficiently separates the data into two distinct clusters. The resulting clusters highlight similarities among data points, grouping them based on proximity to centroids, which aids in tasks like anomaly detection and data segmentation.

Incorporating tools such as Apache Spark and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), the project demonstrates the scalability, fault tolerance, and parallel processing capabilities essential for handling large-scale datasets. The insights derived from k-means clustering can be applied across various fields, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and pattern visualization.
